## WTF is Tic Tac Toe
It's a puzzle game played by two players per turn per turn, the aim of which is to create a grid alignment first.\
The game is usually played with paper and pencil when you're bored in a classroom.\
We've created the future for you, a Tic Tac Toe on your computer, WOW SUCH MINDBLOWING.
